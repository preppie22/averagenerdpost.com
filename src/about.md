# About Me {style="margin-top: 0;"}

![Picture of Piyush Puranik](/assets/images/me.jpg){ class="avatar" eleventy:widths=700 }

My name is Piyush and I'm a data scientist. I graduated from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) with a Ph.D. in computer science in 2024 and I specialize in applied data science and machine learning. Currently, I'm working at the UNLV International Gaming Institute (IGI) leveraging my skills to find risk taking and harmful gambling behavior from player data.

Since childhood, I've had this obsession with finding patterns in numbers. Now this doesn't mean that I'm amazing at math. But, I'm still drawn to patterns and finding them in data. This is basically what lead me to computer science: I knew this was one place where I could could gather the skills necessary to do what I enjoy. The doctorate was basically because I didn't want to stop. I think that's still the case which is why I stuck to academia.

Have you ever had that kid in class who was nerdy, annoying, loved physics and computers? That was me. Kinda like Jason Fox from [FoxTrot](https://foxtrot.com/) but maybe not as smart. I've always believed that knowledge shouldn't be behind a paywall, but its application and any product derived from it is fair game. For example, the [LZMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZMA) compression method (7zip) is open source, but you can totally write an application that implements it and sell it. Having knowledge on fundamental technologies open to the public encourages research and improves the lives of everyone on this planet.
